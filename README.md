## Description
This project implements a binary tree with the following features:
- Nodes with unique IDs, integer data fields, and left/right child references.
- A method to insert values into the tree based on binary search rules.
- A method to serialize the tree structure into a formatted string.

- **Node Class**:
  - Contains a unique `nodeID`, `data` field, and references to left/right children.
- **BinaryTree Class**:
  - `insert(data)`: Inserts a value into the tree.
  - `dumpTree()`: Serializes the tree structure as a string.

## Example Output
After inserting values 10, 5, and 15:
